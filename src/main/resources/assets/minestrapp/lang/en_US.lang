guide.guidance.oak_leaves.title=Oak Leaves
guide.guidance.oak_leaves.desc=Leaves from an Oak tree. Drops Oak Saplings when harvested normally, though the block itself can be obtained by harvesting it with Shears. Generated Leaves despawn over time if too far away from a Log, while player-placed Leaves will never despawn. All types of Leaves, however, are very flammable and can be used as somewhat inefficient fuel.
guide.guidance.birch_leaves.title=Birch Leaves
guide.guidance.birch_leaves.desc=Leaves from a Birch tree. Drops Birch Saplings when harvested normally, though the block itself can be obtained by harvesting it with Shears.

All types of Leaves, however, are very flammable and can be used as somewhat inefficient fuel.
guide.guidance.brown_mushroom_block.title=Brown Mushroom Block
guide.guidance.brown_mushroom_block.desc=A block from a Huge Brown Mushroom. It sometimes drops a Brown Mushroom when broken, unless harvested with Silk Touch. Though it doesn't have as many uses as normal Brown Mushrooms, it can be used as fuel or melted into more efficient stew.
guide.guidance.red_mushroom_block.title=Red Mushroom Block
guide.guidance.red_mushroom_block.desc=A block from a Huge Red Mushroom. It sometimes drops a Red Mushroom when broken, unless harvested with Silk Touch. Though it doesn't have as many uses as normal Red Mushrooms, it can be used as fuel or melted into more efficient stew.
guide.guidance.vine.title=Vines
guide.guidance.vine.desc=A hanging, tangled mat of Vines commonly seen in Swamps and Jungles. It grows and spreads along the sides of blocks, and can hang in open air provided there is another Vine block above it. The thick, knotted tendrils are so sturdy that they can be climbed in the same manner as a Ladder - but only when there is a block located behind them.
guide.guidance.reeds.title=Sugar Cane
guide.guidance.reeds.desc=A bundle of thin, bamboo-like stalks often found growing on the coasts of Rivers, lakes, and Oceans. Can be planted on any Sand, Dirt, Grass, or Podzol block that has a neighboring Water block to produce a Sugar Cane plant, which will grow up to 3 blocks tall before stopping.
guide.guidance.cactus.title=Cactus
guide.guidance.cactus.desc=A prickly, thorn-coated plant found in Desert biomes. While its short arms won't hurt the player, running into the base will, making it useful for protecting your yard from monsters. When broken, it can be re-planted on Sand, Red Sand, or other Cacti. A single Cactus block will grow to 3 block high over time, but they can be manually stacked as high as you want. It has few crafting uses, but can be smelted into Green Dye.
guide.guidance.melon.title=Melon
guide.guidance.melon.desc=An enormous, cubic Melon block. It bursts into slices when harvested without Silk Touch.
guide.guidance.pumpkin.title=Pumpkin
guide.guidance.pumpkin.desc=A cube-shaped Pumpkin with the vine still growing on one side. Though it does not seem to posess any unique qualities, it has been found that Pumpkins have some connection with Golemancy, and can be placed in certain configurations with other blocks to form different types of utility Golems. If you don't want to make it into food, you could always try carving it. Wearing a Pumpkin on your head is said to help avoid the wrath of Endermen, but then again, you wouldn't be able to see a thing...
guide.guidance.sponge.title=Sponge
guide.guidance.sponge.desc=A dry Sponge block. When placed in Water, it will remove all the Water sources within a certain area and become Wet. The Water, however, is prone to re-filling in around the Sponge afterward, so it is easier to remove water located in a small, enclosed area.
guide.guidance.wet_sponge.title=Wet Sponge
guide.guidance.wet_sponge.desc=A wet Sponge block. Doesn't absorb Water like a dry Sponge would, but it can be dried again by smelting it.
guide.guidance.chorus_plant.title=Chorus Plant
guide.guidance.chorus_plant.desc=The stem of one of the strange, tentacle-like plants native to the outer reaches of the End. It is oddly squishy and coated in light-purple veins. It does not drop itself when harvested, even while using Silk Touch, but has a chance of dropping a Chorus Fruit, which seem to grow inside the bulbous sacks that appear on some of the stem blocks. Because of this, the Chorus Plants themselves can only be obtained via the Dimensional Fishery. Chorus Plants and Flowers can only be planted on End Stone or other Chorus Plants, and breaking one Chorus Plant block will cause a chain reaction, breaking all the others above it.
guide.guidance.chorus_flower.title=Chorus Flower
guide.guidance.chorus_flower.desc=The Flower of one of the strange, tentacle-like plants native to the outer reaches of the End. When planted on End Stone, it will grow upwards over time, leaving a long stem of Chorus Plant blocks in its wake. Chorus Flowers also have a chance to split into two separate stems while growing, allowing Chorus Plants to slowly form many branching trunks. When a Chorus Flower has stopped growing, its flower will close, turning the block the same dark purple as the rest of the stem. Dead Chorus Flowers can, however, be harvested again and re-planted to start growing a new Chorus plant. While breaking part of the Chorus Plant's stem will destroy the rest of the plant, it will not drop its flowers, requiring the player to manually harvest them if they wish to grow more Chorus Plants.



## Soil Blocks ##
guide.guidance.dirt.title=Dirt
guide.guidance.dirt.desc=A block of Dirt, found abundantly in the Overworld. Grass and Mycellium blocks can spread to it when placed, and it can be tilled into Farmland. Can sustain most Overworld plants, though not quite as many as Grass.
guide.guidance.coarse_dirt.title=Coarse Dirt
guide.guidance.coarse_dirt.desc=A block of Gravel-crusted Dirt, which Grass cannot spread to. It can be tilled back into normal Dirt.
guide.guidance.grass.title=Grass
guide.guidance.grass.desc=A block of Dirt with a layer of grass growing on it. When placed, it will spread to nearby Dirt blocks, provided they are recieving a high enough light level. Can sustain most Overworld plants, including Tall Grass, Saplings, Berry Bushes, etcetera. Drops Dirt if mined without Silk Touch, and can be tilled into Farmland.
guide.guidance.podzol.title=Podzol
guide.guidance.podzol.desc=A block of Dirt coated in dead leaves and other plant matter. Found commonly in Redwood and Mega Taiga biomes. Unlike Grass, it cannot spread to nearby Dirt blocks, but still drops Dirt when harvested without Silk Touch. Mushrooms and Moss can grow on Podzol at any light level, and most types of Seeds and Saplings can be found by sifting it.
guide.guidance.mycelium.title=Mycelium
guide.guidance.mycelium.desc=A block of Dirt coated in a purple, fungal crust, somewhat similar to Grass. Like Grass, it will spread to nearby Dirt blocks with a high enough light level over time, though it can sustain far less plant species than Grass. Unlike Grass, however, Mycelium can sustain Mushrooms at any light level and in direct sunlight, a property only shared by Podzol. Mycelium itself cannot be tilled, though the Dirt it drops when mined without Silk Touch can.
guide.guidance.sand.title=Sand
guide.guidance.sand.desc=A block of Sand, found extremely commonly in Beaches, Deserts, Rivers, and Oceans. It can sustain Cacti and Dead Shrubs, and is affected by gravity. While Sand blocks themselves are limited in uses, they are used in making Sandstone and Glass, both highly useful decorative blocks.
guide.guidance.red_sand.title=Red Sand
guide.guidance.red_sand.desc=A red-tinted Sand block found in Mesa biomes. It functions identically to normal Sand, but can be crafted into Red Sandstone instead of normal Sandstone.
guide.guidance.clay.title=Clay
guide.guidance.clay.desc=A block of thick, clumpy earth found commonly at the bottoms of Swamps and River beds. It drops 4 Clay Balls when harvested without Silk Touch, and the block itself can be smelted into Hardened Clay.
guide.guidance.gravel.title=Gravel
guide.guidance.gravel.desc=A block of crumbled stones found commonly in Overworld caves, as well as the Nether. Occasionally known as "Miner's Bane", Gravel can often kill players who dig upwards into a Gravel deposit, as it is affected by gravity. It can, however, be sifted to produce some useful items.
guide.guidance.soul_sand.title=Soul Sand
guide.guidance.soul_sand.desc=A brown, sticky sand that slows entities walking through it. It could be a trick of the light, but the shadows on the surface look almost like faces, and it seems to be emitting an almost imperceptible screaming sound...



## Frozen Blocks ##
guide.guidance.snow_layer.title=Snow
guide.guidance.snow_layer.desc=A thin layer of Snow, often found coating the ground in snowy biomes. Snow layers can be stacked up to 8 times, with a single layer being 2 pixels tall, and 8 layers being a full block. When broken, they drop nothing unless harvested with a Shovel, in which case they drop a number of Snowballs corresponding to the number of stacked layers. Snow Layers will melt over time when placed near a light source. Snowy weather will also create Snow Layers on the ground, though they will not stack any higher than one layer.
guide.guidance.snow.title=Block of Snow
guide.guidance.snow.desc=A solid block of Snow. Mostly decorative, though its fast mining speed makes it useful as scaffolding. It drops nothing when broken, unless harvested with a Shovel, in which case it drops 4 Snowballs. Unlike Snow Layers, it does not melt when near light sources.
guide.guidance.ice.title=Ice
guide.guidance.ice.desc=A block of frozen water. Ice can be found covering the rivers and lakes in snowy biomes, and drops nothing when broken unless harvested with Silk Touch. It is slippery, and is thus often useful for transporting items or entities long distances. Any Water sources will turn into Ice over time when placed in a snowy biome with exposure to the sun, making it easily obtainable and renewable. Like Snow Layers, Ice will melt into a Water source when placed near any light source.
guide.guidance.packed_ice.title=Packed Ice
guide.guidance.packed_ice.desc=A block of hardened, compressed Ice, found in huge spike-like formations in Ice Spikes biomes. Like Ice, it drops nothing unless harvested with Silk Touch, but unlike Ice it cannot be melted by any light source, and will not create a Water source when broken by any means. This behavior makes it far more useful for building than Ice, as it can have torches and light sources placed near it with no negative consequences. It will not form naturally on the surface of Water like normal Ice will, but can be created by freezing Ice blocks using a Frost Generator.



## Stone Blocks ##
guide.guidance.stone.title=Stone
guide.guidance.stone.desc=A grey, rather standard-looking type of stone. Commonly found near the surface in mild biomes. It drops a block of Cobblestone when mined without Silk Touch.

guide.guidance.hardened_clay.title=Hardened Clay
guide.guidance.hardened_clay.desc=A block of dried, hardened Clay, also known as adobe. While it can be obtained by smelting Clay Blocks, it is far easier to obtain by finding a Mesa biome, where it composes a vast majority of the above-ground terrain. Oddly, Hardened Clay is able to sustain Dead Bushes, while regular Clay Blocks cannot.
guide.guidance.prismarine.title=Prismarine
guide.guidance.prismarine.desc=A mysterious alloy of Radiant Quartz and Coldstone, found in abundance in the grand Torian ocean monuments. It seems to be somewhat opalescent, slowly changing color as the light hits it from different angles. The Guardians that now inhabit these now-abandoned Torian relics seem to be made of Prismarine, though the Golemancy required to construct them is yet unknown.
guide.guidance.netherrack.title=Netherrack
guide.guidance.netherrack.desc=A strange, somewhat mushy, red block of stone found just about everywhere in the Nether. The stench it emits is nearly unbearable, and it's unclear what gives it such a vivid color, but it is quite useful in its ability to sustain a flame indefinitely.
guide.guidance.magma.title=Magma Block
guide.guidance.magma.desc=A block of cooled Magma, found in abundance in the lower reaches of the Nether. While you cannot sink into it like you would in Lava, standing on it will still hurt players and other mobs unless they are sneaking. Unlike Cactus, however, Magma will not destroy items or non-living entities that land on it, making it useful for mob killing systems. Magma also has one unique property shared only by Invincium - its ability to "store" light. When a Magma block recieves light from another block, the Magma block will continue to emit the light level it recieved, even if the original light source is removed. This property makes Magma blocks very useful for decorative lighting, as you can control the exact light level each block emits by placing light sources various distances away from it.
guide.guidance.glowstone.title=Glowstone
guide.guidance.glowstone.desc=A glowing block of lumpy, luminescent pebbles that seem to be stuck together with a great deal of Glowmoss sap. It can be found growing in almost stalactite-like clusters dripping from the roof of the Nether. It emits a bright light level when placed, making it useful for both decorative and underwater lighting. It drops 2-4 Glowstone Dust when mined, unless harvested with Silk Touch.
guide.guidance.end_stone.title=End Stone
guide.guidance.end_stone.desc=A block of porous, white stone found abundantly in the End. Though it doesn't seem to have any significant magical properties, it is the only block that can sustain Chorus plants, and seems to be hospitable to Glow Moss as well.
guide.guidance.obsidian.title=Obsidian
guide.guidance.obsidian.desc=A block of shiny, black volcanic glass formed by rapidly cooled Lava. It seems to possess trans-dimensional properties, and is said to have been frequently used by the Farlanders before their dissapearance.
guide.guidance.bedrock.title=Bedrock
guide.guidance.bedrock.desc=The hardest minable stone in any dimension. In most dimensions, it can be found at the very bottom of the world, just above the Invincium layer. It deals enormous durability damage to any Pickaxe used to mine it, is impervious to explosions, and can only be harvested with a Titanium Pickaxe or better. It can, however, be used to craft Bedrock Tools, which have the highest durability of any toolset.



## Ores ##
guide.guidance.coal_ore.title=Coal Ore
guide.guidance.coal_ore.desc=A stone block with traces of Coal embedded in it. It can be found very commonly in large veins at most altitudes. It drops one Coal when mined without Silk Touch, though this number can be increased by mining it with Fortune.
guide.guidance.iron_ore.title=Iron Ore
guide.guidance.iron_ore.desc=A stone block with traces of Iron embedded in it. It can be found fairly commonly in medium-sized veins at most altitudes below sea level.
guide.guidance.gold_ore.title=Gold Ore
guide.guidance.gold_ore.desc=A stone block with traces of Gold embedded in it. It can be found semi-rarely in small veins deep underground, but can also be found in enormous quantities at high altitudes in Mesa biomes.
guide.guidance.redstone_ore.title=Redstone Ore
guide.guidance.redstone_ore.desc=A stone block with Redstone Dust embedded in it. It can be found somewhat often in medium-sized veins deep underground. It drops 4-5 Redstone Dust when mined without Silk Touch, though this number can be increased by mining it with Fortune.
guide.guidance.lapis_ore.title=Lapis Lazuli Ore
guide.guidance.lapis_ore.desc=A stone block with traces of Lapis Lazuli embedded in it. It can be found semi-rarely in small veins deep underground. It drops 4-8 Lapis Lazuli when mined without Silk Touch, though this number can be increased by mining it with Fortune.
guide.guidance.diamond_ore.title=Diamond Ore
guide.guidance.diamond_ore.desc=A stone block with Diamonds embedded in it. It can be found rarely in small veins very deep underground. It drops 1 Diamond when mined without Silk Touch, though this number can be increased by mining it with Fortune.
guide.guidance.emerald_ore.title=Emerald Ore
guide.guidance.emerald_ore.desc=A stone block with Emeralds embedded in it. It can be found very rarely in tiny veins underground in Extreme Hills biomes. It drops 1 Emerald when mined without Silk Touch, though this number can be increased by mining it with Fortune.
guide.guidance.quartz_ore.title=Nether Quartz Ore
guide.guidance.quartz_ore.desc=A Netherrack block with traces of Nether Quartz embedded in it. It can be found commonly in large veins in the Nether. It drops 1 Nether Quartz when mined without Silk Touch, though this number can be increased by mining it with Fortune.



## Resource ##
guide.guidance.hay_block.title=Hay Bale
guide.guidance.hay_block.desc=A block of tied-together Wheat bundles. Unlike Wheat, it cannot be used to breed mobs - it can, however, be fed to Horses, Donkeys, and Mules to heal up to 10 hearts of their health, and can be fed to Foals to speed up their growth. Falling onto a Hay Bale will also reduce the fall damage taken by 80%, allowing un-armored players to survive falls of up to 100 blocks.
guide.guidance.bone_block.title=Bone Block
guide.guidance.bone_block.desc=An enormous, cubic bone, found in the fossils of ancient creatures that can be seen rarely underground. Like Pillars and Logs, these can be placed facing three different directions. They are mostly decorative, but can be crafted into 9 Bonemeal and artificially replicated with the same materials, making it useful for storing large quantities of Bonemeal.
guide.guidance.slime_block.title=Slime Block
guide.guidance.slime_block.desc=A block of compressed, gelatinous Slime. It slows any entities walking on it, and falling onto it will bounce you back into the air without dealing any fall damage. Holding shift while you land on it will cancel this effect, but you will also take as much damage as you would from falling onto any other block. Additionally, Slime Blocks have the unique property of being able to vicariously move adjacent blocks whenever it is pushed or pulled by a Piston - i.e., if a Slime Block is in front of the Piston and a Dirt block is to the right of the Slime Block, both the Slime Block and the Dirt Block will be pushed when the Piston is activated. Multiple Slime and other Blocks can be chained together in this manner, allowing for complex flying machines, tunnelling devices, secret doors, etcetera. The limit of 12 blocks that can be pushed with a Piston does apply to all Slime and attatched blocks, however, limiting their capabilities somewhat.
guide.guidance.nether_wart_block.title=Nether Wart Block
guide.guidance.nether_wart_block.desc=A block of compacted Nether Wart. Mostly useful for decoration and storage.
guide.guidance.coal_block.title=Block of Coal

Mostly useful for decoration and compressed storage, but it can also be used as a fuel source that can smelt up to 80 items in a Furnace - 10 more items than could be smelted with the 9 Coal used to craft it. Coal blocks are also flammable, and take notably longer to burn than most other flammable blocks.
guide.guidance.iron_block.title=Block of Iron

## Decor ##
guide.guidance.torch.title=Torch
guide.guidance.torch.desc=A flaming Stick. Useful for lighting up caves, as well as for decorative home lighting. It can be placed on the top or sides of any solid block, but breaks off if that block is broken. Strangely, it doesn't seem to be capable of igniting other blocks, despite being on fire itself.
guide.guidance.end_rod.title=End Rod
guide.guidance.end_rod.desc=A decorative, Sunstone light source found commonly in the lost cities of the Farlanders. Though its appearance is somewhat reminescent of a Torch, its behavior differs in many ways. It can be placed facing in all 6 directions as opposed to 5, and will not break if the block it was placed on is removed. It is also solid, unlike Torches, making it useful for building self-lighted fences and staircases as well.
guide.guidance.flower_pot.title=Flower Pot
guide.guidance.flower_pot.desc=A clay pot designed to hold small, decorative plants. Any type of one-block-tall Flower, Mushroom, or Sapling can be planted in it, as well as Ferns, Dead Bushes, and even Cacti.
guide.guidance.banner.title=Banner
guide.guidance.banner.desc=A decorative Banner made of Wool. It is the most visually customizable of all the blocks, and can be emblazened with countless different designs by applying various dyes, blocks, and items to it. Banners start off with one of 16 different base colors, each corresponding to the color of Wool used to craft it. They can then have layers applied to them, adding another visual element to their design. Each layer consists of dyes, which specify the color and shape of the element based on their placement in the crafting grid, and sometimes other blocks and items such as Brick Blocks or Vines, which can emblazen specialty designs onto the Banner's face. Only 6 designs can be applied to one Banner, however, so be sure to plan your design before slathering your Banner with excessive layers. Banners can additionally be applied to Shields, decorating the Shield with a miniaturized version of the Banner's design.
guide.guidance.sign.title=Sign
guide.guidance.sign.desc=A small, wooden sign. When placed, you can type up to 4 lines of text on it. Signs are also impervious to liquids and have no collision, making them useful for controling Water flows - they can, however, be ignited by Lava.
guide.guidance.painting.title=Painting
guide.guidance.painting.desc=A decorative painted canvas of Wool and Wood. Despite using no particularly unusual ingredients in their recipe, Paintings still exhibit some distinctly magical properties. For one thing, despite being crafted with an un-decorated block of Wool, Paintings seem to always display one of 19 different paintings done by the Human artist Kristoffer Zetterstrand. There is no easy way to determine which of these 19 paintings will appear when the item is placed, either - it seems to change every time the Painting is broken and replaced. Additionally, though the item stays the same size at all times, the placed paintings vary widely in scale, ranging from 1x1 block portraits to huge 4x4 block tapestries. The Painting's size can be somewhat controlled due to this behavior - placed Paintings will only choose from designs that will fit in the area they are placed in. As one would expect, Paintings can only be placed on the sides of solid blocks, but unlike any other block, they do not restrict further block placement once placed - non-solid blocks can be placed within the block/blocks of space that the Painting takes up as if it were not there at all. Paintings are also non-solid, making them particularly useful for concealing hidden doorways or light sources.
guide.guidance.glass_pane.title=Glass Pane

guide.guidance.trapdoor.desc=A small, horizontally hinged, wooden door. It can be opened by right-clicking it or powering it with Redstone.

guide.guidance.ender_chest.title=Ender Chest
guide.guidance.ender_chest.desc=An enchanted Chest made of Obsidian. Using Farlandian dimensional rift technology, anyone who opens the Chest is able to access their own personal pocket dimension, in which they can store up to 27 stacks of items.

guide.guidance.beacon.title=Beacon
guide.guidance.beacon.desc=A powerful magical artifact that can grant unending status effects to any players within its radius. To function, it must be placed on a pyramid-shaped base of mineral blocks such as Blocks of Iron, Blocks of Diamond, Blocks of Meurodite, or even Radiant Quartz blocks. Each level of the pyramid must be two blocks wider than the last, starting with a 3x3 square under the Beacon and continuing downwards. Only the top 3x3 layer is required for basic functionality, but additional layers will increase the Beacon's effect range and unlock additional status effects. Once the base is properly set up, the Beacon will emit a beam of light, indicating that you may select your desired status buffs by clicking on their icons, placing an Iron Ingot, Gold Ingot, or Diamond in the slot, and clicking the check mark. Only one effect can be selected from each column - the left includes 5 different potion effects, and the right can either add Regeneration I, or buff the effect selected in the left column. Besides their status bonuses, Beacons are especially useful for navigational landmarks, and their beam color can be changed by placing Stained Glass blocks or panes above them.
guide.guidance.end_portal_frame.title=End Portal Frame

guide.guidance.light_weighted_pressure_plate.desc=A golden Pressure Plate that emits a Redstone signal equivalent to the number of entities currently located on top of it, including items, players, and mobs.
guide.guidance.heavy_weightedpressure_plate.title=Iron Weighted Pressure Plate
guide.guidance.heavy_weighted_pressure_plate.desc=An Iron Pressure Plate that emits a Redstone signal based on the number of entities currently located on top of it. Unlike Golden Pressure Plates, Iron Pressure Plates require 10 entities to increase the Redstone signal strength each level.
guide.guidance.tripwire_hook.title=Tripwire Hook
guide.guidance.tripwire_hook.desc=A metal hook on a wood base, used for building lines of Tripwire. When placed opposite another Tripwire Hook and connected to said Hook with String, the two Hooks will emit a Redstone signal any time an entity touches any part of the connecting String. Additionally, the Hooks will also emit a Redstone pulse if any part of the String is broken without Shears, preventing players from easily defusing Tripwire traps.
guide.guidance.daylight_detector.title=Daylight Sensor
guide.guidance.daylight_detector.desc=A delicate Quartz mechanism that emits a Redstone current relative to the amount of sunlight it is recieving. Artificial light will not affect its output, and placing opaque blocks above it will lower or negate the signal it emits. It can also be switched to inverted mode by right-clicking it, which will cause its behavior to invert, emitting a stronger signal the less sunlight it recieves.
guide.guidance.redstone_torch.title=Redstone Torch
guide.guidance.redstone_torch.desc=A special Torch fueled by Redstone rather than Coal. It acts like a normal Torch, but emits far less light. It does, however, emit a full Redstone signal to any adjacent Redstone Dust or components, and stops emitting current when the block it is placed on is powered. This behavior makes it extremely useful for things like inverting Redstone current, building Redstone logic gates, and moving Redstone current vertically.
guide.guidance.redstone_block.title=Block of Redstone
guide.guidance.redstone_block.desc=A block of compacted Redstone Dust. It acts as a constant source of Redstone current, emitting a full Redstone signal to its neighboring blocks at all times when placed. While its basic function is similar to a Redstone Torch, it has the added benefit of being a solid block, thus allowing it to be pushed by Pistons. Redstone Blocks are a valuable asset to those who specialize in compact Redstone machinery, and are unique in being the only Redstone power source that cannot be turned off by any means while placed. Unlike other mineral blocks, however, they cannot be used in constructing the base for a Beacon.
guide.guidance.redstone.title=Redstone
guide.guidance.redstone.desc=A strange, red, conductive type of dust. It can be placed on the ground to form a sort of binary electrical wiring that can power various machines and mechanisms. Redstone Dust can connect to adjacent Redstone Dust, adjacent Redstone mechanisms, or even adjacent Dust located one block above or below itself. Redstone current can travel through a maximum of 15 Redstone Dust blocks, and can also be transfered through solid, non-Redstone blocks in certain situations.
guide.guidance.redstone_repeater.title=Redstone Repeater
guide.guidance.redstone_repeater.desc=A small Redstone device designed to extend a Redstone current. A Repeater recieving any level of Redstone current will emit a full level 15 current in the direction it is facing, allowing it to effectively extend a signal farther than 15 blocks. Powering a Repeater from the side using another Repeater will lock the first Repeater in whichever power state it was in, no matter whether it is currently recieving power or not - a trick that becomes quite useful for logic gates and the like.
guide.guidance.redstone_comparator.title=Redstone Comparator
guide.guidance.redstone_comparator.desc=A complex Redstone mechanism used for many different applications. Its primary function is to compare the strengths of two lines of Redstone dust - if the level of Redstone power it is recieving from the side is greater than the power level it is recieving from the back, it will output a Redstone signal from the front. They level of this signal, however, varies based on its state - if the Redstone Torch in the front is off, it will output the same level of current it was recieving from the back. If the Torch is on, however, it will output a current level equivalent to the strength of the side signal minus the strength of the back signal. This mode can be toggled by right-clicking the Comparator. Additionally, Comparators placed near any container block, as well as many other blocks with various detectable attributes, including Cauldrons, Item Frames, and Hourglasses, will output a signal strength relative to the container's fullness or the other blocks' current status.
guide.guidance.rail.title=Rail
guide.guidance.rail.desc=A set of Iron tracks designed to guide a Minecart. Placing a Minecart on the tracks will attach it to the Rails, where it can be moved freely along the track. Adjacent Minecart Rails will attach to one another, and can even attach to rails one block above or below themselves. Normal Rails do now, however, move their Minecarts, which must be powered along by other means. Additionally, mobs will avoid walking over Rails when they can, making them useful for routing monsters to specific locations.
guide.guidance.golden_rail.title=Powered Rail
guide.guidance.golden_rail.desc=A special, golden piece of Minecart track that, when powered, increases the velocity of any Minecart that moves over it. While unpowered, it does the opposite, acting as a form of breaks. It can connect to adjacent rails located one block above it, but, unlike normal Rails, cannot curve to connect to rails on two adjacent sides.
guide.guidance.detector_rail.title=Detector Rail
guide.guidance.detector_rail.desc=A special type of rail that emits a Redstone signal whenever a Minecart passes over it. It also outputs a Comparator signal relative to the inventory of any Chest or Hopper Minecarts that pass over it. It can connect to adjacent rails located one block above it, but, unlike normal Rails, cannot curve to connect to rails on two adjacent sides.
guide.guidance.activator_rail.title=Activator Rail
guide.guidance.activator_rail.desc=A special type of Rail that, when powered by Redstone, will eject any players or mobs from any Minecarts that pass over it. It will also ignite any TNT Minecarts that pass over it, as well as lock any Hopper Minecarts sitting on top of it, preventing them from picking up or dispensing items.
guide.guidance.redstone_lamp.title=Redstone Lamp
guide.guidance.redstone_lamp.desc=A simple Redstone mechanism that emits a bright light when powered.
guide.guidance.piston.title=Piston
guide.guidance.piston.desc=A Redstone mechanism used for pushing blocks from place to place. When powered, the Piston's "head" will extend in the direction it is facing, pushing any adjacent blocks forward one block. Pistons can push up to 12 blocks at once, and beyond that they will simply refuse to activate. Additionally, certain blocks will break rather than move when pushed, such as Buttons, Levers, and Torches, and some blocks, such as Obsidian, Chests, Furnaces, and Invincium, cannot be pushed at all.
guide.guidance.sticky_piston.title=Sticky Piston
guide.guidance.sticky_piston.desc=A Piston with Slime slathered over its head. It behaves just like a normal Piston, but can pull blocks back towards it in addition to pushing them.
guide.guidance.hopper.title=Hopper
guide.guidance.hopper.desc=An extremely useful apparatus which can remove items from containers and place them into others. Unlike Pipes, it can only face in 5 different directions, but has the added functionality of being able to take items out of any container placed directly above it, including Chest Minecarts, Crates, Barrels, Pipes, and even other Hoppers. Items laying on top of the Hopper will also be pulled in, making it useful when swapping between long-distance, Water stream item transportation and short-distance Pipe transportation. Hoppers also have 5 slots of inventory space as opposed to the 1 of Pipes, and can additionally be locked by powering them with Redstone, preventing them from sucking in or spitting out items.
guide.guidance.dropper.title=Dropper
guide.guidance.dropper.desc=A Redstone mechanism used for transfering items between containers, as well as dispensing them from containers onto the ground. The Dropper's GUI functions the same way as a normal Chest, but with only 9 slots instead of 27. Unlike Chests, however, it can be placed facing in all 6 directions, and, when powered, will dispense one of its items from its front face. This dispensing behavior varies based on what block is located immediately adjacent to its front face. If it is a container block (such as a Chest or a Hopper), it will place the item directly into the container's inventory - otherwise, it will simply drop the item on the ground in the direction it is facing. Like most other containers, Droppers will also emit a Comparator signal relative to the fullness of its own inventory. This behavior makes it very useful for counting mechanisms and timers, as well as transporting items upwards (though this can often be accomplished more easily via Pipes).
guide.guidance.dispenser.title=Dispenser
guide.guidance.dispenser.desc=A Redstone mechanism used for dispensing items. It works similarly to a Dropper, but when dispensing projectiles such as Snowballs, Eggs, Arrows, Splash Potions, etc, it will throw them in their projectile form rather than drop them as an item. It will also dispense activated TNT when firing TNT blocks, place Pumpkins and Wither Skulls on top of Golem/Wither bases, place Boats and Minecarts on Water/Rails, and place/remove Water and Lava sources via buckets.
guide.guidance.noteblock.title=Note Block
guide.guidance.noteblock.desc=A Redstone mechanism that plays a note when powered. Right-clicking it changes its pitch, and the instrument played varies based on the material of the block located below it.



## Tool/Machine ##
guide.guidance.crafting_table.title=Crafting Table
guide.guidance.crafting_table.desc=One of the most useful blocks in the game, this wooden workbench can be used to craft an enormous variety of blocks and items. Its interface works the same as the in-inventory crafting menu, but with a 3x3 grid instead of a 2x2 - placing certain items in certain configurations on the grid will produce other items, which can be picked out of the slot to the right of the crafting grid.
guide.guidance.anvil.title=Anvil
guide.guidance.anvil.desc=A heavy, Iron apparatus for repairing damaged items. Damaged Tools, Weapons, or Armor go in the left slot, while their corresponding material (i.e.; an Iron Ingot for repairing an Iron Pickaxe) goes in the middle slot. Picking the result out of the right slot repairs the tool, consumes the repair material, and deducts the indicated amount of experience - provided you have enough to begin with. Items can also be re-named using the text bar at the top, multiple items of the same type can be combined into one by placing one in each of the two input slots, and enchantments can be applied via Enchanted Books by placing the Book in the middle slot and the item to be enchanted on the left. Unlike most utility blocks, Anvils will break over time as you use them, as indicated by the cracks on their top surface. They are also affected by gravity, and will greatly damage any mobs or players they hit while falling.
guide.guidance.furnace.title=Furnace
guide.guidance.furnace.desc=A small, stone oven used for smelting certain blocks and items into other blocks and items. To-be-smelted items go in the top left slot, and fuel items go in the bottom left slot. If the top left item can be smelted, the smelting process will start, and the fuel will begin to deplete - each fuel source lasts a different duration than others. Once the arrow in the center fills up completely, the smelting result can be picked out of the right slot. This block is also a necessary ingredient in several later game machines.
guide.guidance.enchanting_table.title=Enchantment Table
guide.guidance.enchanting_table.desc=A magical utility block designed for casting enchantments on tools, weapons, and armor. The GUI contains two slots and three empty bars to the right of them. When an enchantable tool, weapon, or piece of armor is placed in the left slot, and some Lapis Lazuli is placed in the right, the three slots on the right will light up, displaying the enchantment possibilities. The XP Orb with the number to the left of each of these bars indicates how many levels will be spent on the enchantment, while the number on the bottom right of the bar indicates the level the player must be to select it. Mousing over the enchantment options also shows the first of however many enchantments the option contains, though the enchants themselves are randomly selected. Additionally, each numbered option requires the corresponding ammount of Lapis Lazuli to fuel the table - choosing option 1 will consume 1 Lapis from the right slot, while option 3 will consume 3. Upon choosing an enchantment, the item in the left slot will be enchanted, and the Lapis Lazuli will be consumed.
guide.guidance.brewing_stand.title=Brewing Stand
guide.guidance.brewing_stand.desc=A device used for the brewing and bottling of Potions. It must be fueled with Blaze Powder by placing it in the top left slot before it can be used. Once the orange fuel meter has been filled, up to 3 Potions or Water Bottles can be placed in the three slots at the bottom. Once the Bottles are placed and a compatible ingredient has been placed in the top center slot, the Potions will begin brewing, consuming some of the fuel meter and transforming into their resulting forms after a few seconds.



## Crops ##
guide.guidance.wheat_seeds.title=Wheat Seeds
guide.guidance.wheat_seeds.desc=Small, green seeds used for growing Wheat. Wheat Seeds can be found frequently when breaking Tall Grass or sifting various types of soil, and can be planted on Farmland to grow a Wheat crop. Wheat crops go through 7 stages of growth before turning a golden-yellow color at the top of their stalks, indicating that they are ready to harvest. Fully grown Wheat crops will drop 1 Wheat and 1-3 Wheat Seeds, allowing you to grow additional Wheat crops from only one Wheat Seed. Harvesting Wheat Crops before they are fully grown will not drop any Wheat, but will drop Seeds, allowing you to re-plant them if any crops are accidentally broken. Wheat Seeds are also among the various types of Seeds that can be used to breed Chickens, though you can also achieve the same means by simply throwing lots of Eggs.
guide.guidance.wheat.title=Wheat
guide.guidance.wheat.desc=A bundle of Wheat, obtained by harvesting fully grown Wheat crops. While Wheat cannot be eaten on its own, it is particularly useful when made into Dough, which can be either eaten raw or smelted/alloyed into various other food items. Wheat can also be used to breed Sheep, Cows, and Mooshrooms, and can be fed to Horses to heal them by 0.5 hearts, making it a necessity when raising and breeding animals.



## Materials ##
guide.guidance.snowball.title=Snowball
guide.guidance.snowball.desc=A round, compacted ball of Snow, obtained by harvesting Snow Blocks or Layers with a Shovel. Its main use isfor crafting Snow blocks, but it can also be thrown by right-clicking while holding it, which will send it soaring through the air in whatever direction you are facing. Players and mobs that are hit with Snowballs will be knocked back slightly - most, however, will not take any damage from the hit. The exception, however, is Blazes, which, being made of fire, take 1.5 hearts of damage from being hit by a Snowball. Snowballs, like most projectiles, can be fired from Dispensers, making them somewhat useful for pushing mobs into pits or other hazards in mob grinders.
guide.guidance.coal.title=Coal
guide.guidance.coal.desc=A dark, powdery material obtained by mining Coal Ore. Coal's main use is as a fuel source - it can smelt up to 8 blocks or items in a Furnace, making it one of the cheapest and most efficient fuel sources in the Overworld. It is also used in crafting Torches, which are vital to your survival early on. Coal is extremely common underground in the Overworld, so crafting it into Coal Blocks may be necessary if it begins to take up a lot of storage space.
guide.guidance.charcoal.title=Charcoal
guide.guidance.charcoal.desc=A powdery, Coal-like substance obtained by smelting Logs. It behaves exactly the same as Coal for the most part - the one difference, however, is that it cannot be used to produce Steel. Because of this, it is often advisable to use Charcoal as your main fuel source instead of Coal if you are trying to make a lot of Steel Ingots, as you will burn through Coal very fast while alloying it with Iron.
guide.guidance.gunpowder.title=Gunpowder
guide.guidance.gunpowder.desc=A grey, powdery substance commonly found by either killing Creepers or sifting Gravel. It is highly volatile, making it popular as an ingredient in most crafting recipes for anything that is intended to explode. Gunpowder is also required for brewing Splash Potions, and is a vital ingredient for the aspiring brewer.
guide.guidance.flint.title=Flint
guide.guidance.flint.desc=A shard of smooth, black rock, found occasionally when breaking or sifting Gravel. Though it has relatively few uses, it is required for crafting Arrows, making it a valuable resource for players specializing in archery. Flint can also be crafted into Flint Blocks, which have a variety of decorative building variants.
guide.guidance.iron_ingot.title=Iron Ingot
guide.guidance.iron_ingot.desc=A brick-like ingot of solid Iron. Though Iron tools and armor are not as durable as Bronze, nor as efficient as Steel, Iron is still prized for its crafting uses, as it is used in more crafting recipes than almost any other mineral.
guide.guidance.gold_ingot.title=Gold Ingot
guide.guidance.gold_ingot.desc=A brick-like ingot of solid Gold. Though not as practically useful as Copper, Tin, or Iron, Gold is often more valued than all three due to its rarity and decorative uses. Despite Gold tools and armor being next to useless, Gold Ingots have a wide variety of niche crafting uses, and it is often required when crafting magical items or Redstone components.
guide.guidance.diamond.title=Diamond
guide.guidance.diamond.desc=A shiny, teal gemstone prized for being one of the most durable materials available in the Overworld. Its usefulness in crafting incredibly durable and efficient tools, weapons, and armor, along with its rarity, have made it one of the most higly valued of all the minerals available underground.



## Mob Loot ##
guide.guidance.feather.title=Feather
guide.guidance.feather.desc=A white Feather, commonly dropped when killing Chickens. Its most common use is for crafting Arrows - four of which can be crafted with a Feather, a Stick, and some Flint - making them a valuable resource for players specializing in Archery.
guide.guidance.string.title=String
guide.guidance.string.desc=A tangle of silky String, commonly dropped by Spiders. It is used in a variety of crafting recipes, and can also, unlike most items, be placed as a block. Placed String is nearly impossible to see, but will connect to adjacent String blocks similarly to Redstone Dust. By itself, placed Sting has no unique properties, and can be passed through as if it weren't there at all. When connected between two Tripwire Hooks, however, it will cause the Tripwire Hooks to emit a Redstone signal any time any entity touches or breaks any of the String blocks, making it very useful for detecting motion across a wide area.



## Crafting Ingredients ##
guide.guidance.stick.title=Stick
guide.guidance.stick.desc=A wooden stick. It can either be crafted from Planks, or obtained by breaking Dead Bushes or Dead Leaves. Despite its simple appearance, Sticks are one of the most useful of all the crafting ingredients, being used in dozens if not hundreds of different crafting, milling, and alloying recipes. Early-on, Sticks are a vital resource to have at all times, as they are used in crafting not only Torches, but also every type of low to medium-tier tool or weapon.
guide.guidance.bowl.title=Wooden Bowl
guide.guidance.bowl.desc=A simple Bowl, hewn of Wood. It has not practical uses on its own, but can be used to contain a variety of Soups, Salads, and other Bowl-based foods. Bowls are re-usable, and will return to your inventory once their contents have been eaten - the downside to this, however, is that they are not stackable, and thus can take up lots of inventory space if you are carrying multiple bowl-based foods.



## Food ##
guide.guidance.apple.title=Apple
guide.guidance.apple.desc=A round, red Apple that can be rarely found when breaking Oak or Dark Oak Leaves. Eating an apple restores 2 bars of hunger and 2.4 saturation points, making them a useful food when getting started in your world. Apples can also be made into Pies, but their even more useful application is for making Golden Apples, which not only heal more hunger but also grant the consumer various status buffs when eaten.
guide.guidance.golden_apple.title=Golden Apple
guide.guidance.golden_apple.desc=A mysterious artifact commonly found in the abandoned Chests of dungeons, strongholds, and temples. Despite being coated in Gold, it can still be eaten, and provides a number of useful status effects, especially for those engaging in combat with a difficult foe. Eating a Golden Apple restores 2 bars of hunger and 9.6 points of saturation, and will also grant the consumer Absorption I for 2 minutes and Regeneration II for 5 seconds, effectively restoring 2 hearts of damage and adding an additional, 2 non-regenerating hearts of maximum health for the 2 minutes that the effect lasts. This benefit is greatly useful in combat, as it can save you from potentially lethal damage in a pinch, or leave you better equipped for an oncoming fight with its Absorption bonus.
guide.guidance.notch_apple.title=Notch Apple
guide.guidance.notch_apple.desc=A powerful, enchanted form of Golden Apple that can only be found in chests left by ancient Humans and Torians. Like a normal Golden Apple, it will restore 2 bars of hunger and 9.6 points of saturation when eaten, but in addition, it will provide the consumer with Absorption IV for 2 minutes, Regeneration II for 20 seconds, and Fire Resistance I and Resistance I for 5 minutes. This, essentially, restores up to 8 hearts of health over 20 seconds, gives the player 8 extra, non-regenerating hearts of maximum health, reduces all damage they take by 20%, and makes them completely immune to Fire, Lava, and Magma damage. These boosted effects allow Notch Apples to give their user an enormous advantage in any fight, since they more than double their starting health and greatly reduce/eliminate all the damage they might take. They cannot be crafted, however, and are very rare even in dungeon Chests, so saving them for just the right opportunity is highly advised.
guide.guidance.bread.title=Bread
guide.guidance.bread.desc=A filling loaf of fresh baked Bread. It can be made by smelting Dough, making it a reliable food source early-on, as each loaf only costs 2 Wheat. Bread can be eaten to restore 2.5 bars of hunger and 6 saturation points, making it a better alternative to Buns if you have large surpluses of Wheat or Dough. Unlike Buns, however, Bread cannot be used for making any type of sandwiches, making it a less useful food source once you have a wider variety of crops to work with.
guide.guidance.cake.title=Cake
guide.guidance.cake.desc=An attractive looking, white-frosted Cake. It cannot be eaten directly, but once placed, each slice eated by right-clicking will restore 1 bar of hunger and 0.4 saturation points, ammounting to 7 hunger bars and 7 saturation points total. Cakes are often regarded as a symbol of status, due to their high resource cost and relatively low hunger output.
guide.guidance.raw_porkchop.title=Raw Porkchop
guide.guidance.raw_porkchop.desc=A hunk of raw meat, commonly dropped when killing Pigs. It is a fairly poor food source by itself - only restoring 1.5 bars of hunger and 0.6 points of saturation - but restores much more hunger and saturation when cooked. Raw Porkchops can also be fed to tamed Wolves in order to heal/breed them.
guide.guidance.cooked_porkchop.title=Cooked Porkchop
guide.guidance.cooked_porkchop.desc=A cooked slab of meat, obtained by either cooking a Raw Porkchop, or by killing Pigs while they are on fire. Cooked Porkchops restore 4 bars of hunger and 12.8 points of saturation when eaten, making them one of the best "raw" food sources in the game (since they can be obtained without crafting or smelting via flaming Pigs). Like Raw Porkchops, Cooked Porkchops can be fed to tamed Wolves in order to heal or breed them, though it is cheaper to use Raw meats instead, since all meats heal Wolves by the same amount.
guide.guidance.mushroom_stew.title=Mushroom Stew
guide.guidance.mushroom_stew.desc=A creamy stew composed of wild Mushrooms. It can be stored in either a Wooden Bowl or a Bread Bowl, restores 3 bars of hunger (4 if stored in a Bread Bowl), and 7.2 saturation points. Mushroom Stew is a useful food source early-on, as mushrooms can be found somewhat commonly in the wild. It can make for a poor long-term food solution, however, as Mushroom clusters don't often generate in close proximity to each other, and they take a very long time to spread. If Mushrooms prove difficult to find, however, Mushroom Stew can also be obtained by milking Mooshrooms with either type of Bowl, as well as by melting a Giant Mushroom Block into a Bowl.



## Tools ##
guide.guidance.gold_pickaxe.title=Golden Pickaxe
guide.guidance.gold_pickaxe.desc=A decorative but useless Pickaxe made of Gold. It can be used to mine stone-based blocks much faster, but only has 33 uses before it breaks (though enchanting it with Unbreaking may increase this number). Pickaxes can be used for combat, though they are not very effective in most cases - Pickaxes only deal around 66% of the damage of a Sword of the same material, and take 1.3 times as long to recharge after attacking. While soil and wood blocks can often be harvested without a Shovel or Axe, most stone-based blocks require a Pickaxe to harvest, making them one of the most useful and necessary of all the tools.
guide.guidance.gold_axe.title=Golden Axe
guide.guidance.gold_axe.desc=A decorative but useless Axe made of Gold. It can be used to chop wood-based blocks much faster, but only has 33 uses before it breaks (though enchanting it with Unbreaking may increase this number). Axes - unlike most other tools - are actually quite effective when used in combat. Most Axes deal 50% more damage than a Sword of the same material when used as a weapon. They do, however, take much longer to re-charge, so Axe-wielding combatants should be sure to make every strike count. Axes also have the unique ability of being able to break through other players' Shields, and can also, unlike any other tool, be enchanted with Sharpness, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods via Enchanted Books (though they cannot be enchanted with any other Sword enchantments such as Mending or Fire Aspect).
guide.guidance.gold_shovel.title=Golden Shovel
guide.guidance.gold_shovel.desc=A decorative but useless Shovel made of Gold. It can be used to dig soil or snow-based blocks much faster, but only has 33 uses before it breaks (though enchanting it with Unbreaking may increase this number). Shovels can be used for combat, though they are not very effective in most cases - Shovels only deal around 75% of the damage of a Sword of the same material, and take 1.6 times as long to recharge after attacking. In addition to their digging and combat uses, activating Grass with a Shovel will convert it into a Grass Path block, using up 1 of the Shovel's durability.
guide.guidance.gold_hoe.title=Golden Hoe
guide.guidance.gold_hoe.desc=A decorative but useless Hoe made of Gold. Unlike most other standard tools, it cannot be used to break blocks faster, but is instead used for farming - right-clicking Dirt or Permafrost with a Hoe will convert it to Farmland (or Frozen Farmland, respectively), which can be used to grow a variety of crops and plants. Tilling soil consumes 1 point of surability, however, giving it a maximum of 33 uses. Right-clicking any "Coarse" soil with a Hoe will also convert it to its non-Coarse variant - a useful feature when setting up your base in areas with Coarse Dirt or Coarse Permafrost mixed into its terrain. Hoes, like most tools, can be used for combat, though they are the lest powerful of any tool or weapon. All types of Hoes will only deal 0.5 hearts of damage - the same amount as punching an unarmored mob or player. They do, however, have an the fastest attack speed of any item, with high-tiered Hoes having a cooldown time of less than if you were holding nothing at all. This property makes them a weapon of choice for players who do not want to worry about timing their attacks - though at the expense of a much lower damage-per-second ratio.
guide.guidance.wood_pickaxe.title=Wooden Pickaxe
guide.guidance.wood_pickaxe.desc=A sloppily crafted Pickaxe made of Wood. It can be used to mine stone-based blocks slightly faster, and has 60 uses before it breaks (though enchanting it with Unbreaking may increase this number). Pickaxes can be used for combat, though they are not very effective in most cases - Pickaxes only deal around 66% of the damage of a Sword of the same material, and take 1.3 times as long to recharge after attacking. While soil and wood blocks can often be harvested without a Shovel or Axe, most stone-based blocks require a Pickaxe to harvest, making them one of the most useful and necessary of all the tools.
guide.guidance.wood_axe.title=Wooden Axe
guide.guidance.wood_axe.desc=A sloppily crafted Axe made of Iron. It can be used to chop wood-based blocks slightly faster, and has 60 uses before it breaks (though enchanting it with Unbreaking may increase this number). Axes - unlike most other tools - are actually quite effective when used in combat. Most Axes deal 50% more damage than a Sword of the same material when used as a weapon. They do, however, take much longer to re-charge, so Axe-wielding combatants should be sure to make every strike count. Axes also have the unique ability of being able to break through other players' Shields, and can also, unlike any other tool, be enchanted with Sharpness, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods via Enchanted Books (though they cannot be enchanted with any other Sword enchantments such as Mending or Fire Aspect).
guide.guidance.wood_shovel.title=Wooden Shovel
guide.guidance.wood_shovel.desc=A sloppily crafted Shovel made of Wood. It can be used to dig soil or snow-based blocks slightly faster, and has 60 uses before it breaks (though enchanting it with Unbreaking may increase this number). Shovels can be used for combat, though they are not very effective in most cases - Shovels only deal around 75% of the damage of a Sword of the same material, and take 1.6 times as long to recharge after attacking. In addition to their digging and combat uses, activating Grass with a Shovel will convert it into a Grass Path block, using up 1 of the Shovel's durability.
guide.guidance.wood_hoe.title=Wooden Hoe

They do, however, have an the fastest attack speed of any item, with high-tiered Hoes having a cooldown time of less than if you were holding nothing at all. This property makes them a weapon of choice for players who do not want to worry about timing their attacks - though at the expense of a much lower damage-per-second ratio.
guide.guidance.stone_pickaxe.title=Stone Pickaxe
guide.guidance.stone_pickaxe.desc=A roughly hewn Pickaxe made of stone. It can be used to mine stone-based blocks a bit faster, and has 132 uses before it breaks (though enchanting it with Unbreaking may increase this number). Pickaxes can be used for combat, though they are not very effective in most cases - Pickaxes only deal around 66% of the damage of a Sword of the same material, and take 1.3 times as long to recharge after attacking. While soil and wood blocks can often be harvested without a Shovel or Axe, most stone-based blocks require a Pickaxe to harvest, making them one of the most useful and necessary of all the tools.
guide.guidance.stone_axe.title=Stone Axe
guide.guidance.stone_axe.desc=A roughly hewn Axe made of stone. It can be used to chop wood-based blocks a bit faster, and has 132 uses before it breaks (though enchanting it with Unbreaking may increase this number). Axes - unlike most other tools - are actually quite effective when used in combat. Most Axes deal 50% more damage than a Sword of the same material when used as a weapon. They do, however, take much longer to re-charge, so Axe-wielding combatants should be sure to make every strike count. Axes also have the unique ability of being able to break through other players' Shields, and can also, unlike any other tool, be enchanted with Sharpness, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods via Enchanted Books (though they cannot be enchanted with any other Sword enchantments such as Mending or Fire Aspect).
guide.guidance.stone_shovel.title=Stone Shovel
guide.guidance.stone_shovel.desc=A roughly hewn Shovel made of stone. It can be used to dig soil or snow-based blocks a bit faster, and has 132 uses before it breaks (though enchanting it with Unbreaking may increase this number). Shovels can be used for combat, though they are not very effective in most cases - Shovels only deal around 75% of the damage of a Sword of the same material, and take 1.6 times as long to recharge after attacking. In addition to their digging and combat uses, activating Grass with a Shovel will convert it into a Grass Path block, using up 1 of the Shovel's durability.
guide.guidance.stone_hoe.title=Stone Hoe
guide.guidance.stone_hoe.desc=A roughly hewn Hoe made of stone. Unlike most other standard tools, it cannot be used to break blocks faster, but is instead used for farming - right-clicking Dirt or Permafrost with a Hoe will convert it to Farmland (or Frozen Farmland, respectively), which can be used to grow a variety of crops and plants. Tilling soil consumes 1 point of surability, however, giving it a maximum of 132 uses. Right-clicking any "Coarse" soil with a Hoe will also convert it to its non-Coarse variant - a useful feature when setting up your base in areas with Coarse Dirt or Coarse Permafrost mixed into its terrain. Hoes, like most tools, can be used for combat, though they are the lest powerful of any tool or weapon. All types of Hoes will only deal 0.5 hearts of damage - the same amount as punching an unarmored mob or player. They do, however, have an the fastest attack speed of any item, with high-tiered Hoes having a cooldown time of less than if you were holding nothing at all. This property makes them a weapon of choice for players who do not want to worry about timing their attacks - though at the expense of a much lower damage-per-second ratio.
guide.guidance.iron_pickaxe.title=Iron Pickaxe
guide.guidance.iron_pickaxe.desc=A fairly standard Pickaxe made of Iron. It can be used to mine stone-based blocks notably faster, and has 251 uses before it breaks (though enchanting it with Unbreaking may increase this number). Pickaxes can be used for combat, though they are not very effective in most cases - Pickaxes only deal around 66% of the damage of a Sword of the same material, and take 1.3 times as long to recharge after attacking. While soil and wood blocks can often be harvested without a Shovel or Axe, most stone-based blocks require a Pickaxe to harvest, making them one of the most useful and necessary of all the tools.
guide.guidance.iron_axe.title=Iron Axe

guide.guidance.diamond_pickaxe.title=Diamond Pickaxe
guide.guidance.diamond_pickaxe.desc=A high quality Pickaxe made of Diamond. It can be used to mine stone-based blocks much faster, and has 1562 uses before it breaks (though enchanting it with Unbreaking may increase this number). Pickaxes can be used for combat, though they are not very effective in most cases - Pickaxes only deal around 66% of the damage of a Sword of the same material, and take 1.3 times as long to recharge after attacking.

## Specialty Tools ##
guide.guidance.bucket.title=Bucket
guide.guidance.bucket.desc=An empty Bucket made of Iron. It can be used to pick up liquid source blocks by right-clicking them, and, when filled, can be right-clicked again to place the liquid source elsewhere.
guide.guidance.water_bucket.title=Water Bucket
guide.guidance.water_bucket.desc=An Iron Bucket filled with Water. Right-clicking it onto the ground will place the Water source, turning the item back into an empty Bucket. Water sources will generate flowing Water around them (provided there are empty blocks for them to flow into), which will flow across up to 7 blocks' distance, or downwards if there is no block beneath them. Placing two Water sources diagonal to each other with one of their vertical edges touching will create more Water sources in the "corners" between the two, allowing you to create an infinite pool of Water sources. Water can, naturally, be swam in, but staying under too long will deplete your air meter, causing suffocation damage. Water will slow your movement and mining speed while swimming in it, but Boats or Depth-Strider-enchanted Boots can be used to travel quickly through it. Water sources will also freeze into Ice when placed in a snowy biome or near a Frost Generator, making infinite Water sources an easy method of obtaining large quantities of Ice. Additionally, Water and Lava will create various types of Stone when colliding. Flowing Water that touches flowing Lava will create a block of Cobblestone, flowing Lava that touches a Water source will create Stone, and flowing Water that touches a Lava source will create Obsidian, making it a useful method for gathering all three types of blocks.
guide.guidance.lava_bucket.title=Lava Bucket
guide.guidance.lava_bucket.desc=An Iron Bucket filled with Lava. Right-clicking it onto the ground will place the the Lava source, turning the item back into an empty Bucket. Lava sources will generate flowing Lava around them (provided there are empty blocks for them to flow into), which will flow across up to 3 blocks' distance in the Overworld (though it may flow farther in hotter dimensions), or downwards if there is no block beneath them. Unlike Water, Lava cannot form infinite sources, making it more difficult to obtain in large quantities - it can, however, be obtained by melting most stone-based blocks, making it much easier to obtain once you have acquired a Melter. Like Water, Lava can be swam in, but it will deal large amounts of damage and likely kill you if you do not have any Armor enchantments or Potion effects that protect against fire damage. Lava will not cause suffocation damage if you stay under too long, however, meaning that if you do have some way of becoming immune to fire damage, you may stay under the surface indefinitely with no repercussions. There are no Boats or enchantments that allow you to move through Lava faster, making travel across Lava lakes risky and tedious. Lava can, however, be frozen into Obsidian, so if you can find some way of freezing it while moving, it can be traversed over quite easily. Like Fire, Lava also emits light, ignites entities that step in it, destroys items, and ignites nearby flamable blocks over time. Additionally, Water and Lava will create various types of Stone when colliding. Flowing Water that touches flowing Lava will create a block of Cobblestone, flowing Lava that touches a Water source will create Stone, and flowing Water that touches a Lava source will create Obsidian, making it a useful method for gathering all three types of blocks.
guide.guidance.flint_and_steel.title=Flint and Steel
guide.guidance.flint_and_steel.desc=A useful tool for starting Fires. Activating a block with this item will create a Fire on whichever side of the block you were looking at - provided that location is valid for a Fire to be placed. Activating TNT blocks and Creepers with a Flint and Steel will ignite them instantly, though this can be dangerous, as it leaves little time to get out of the way of the ensuing explosion. Flint and Steels can be enchanted with Unbreaking or Mending just like any other tool with durability, though this can only be done via Enchanted Books on an Anvil. While cheap, Flint and Steels can only be used 65 times before breaking, so you are likely to need several when igniting numerous blocks.



## Transportation ##
guide.guidance.saddle.title=Saddle
guide.guidance.saddle.desc=A simple Saddle made of Leather. Though its function seems fairly straightforward, you're unsure how to craft it, as it seems to have a strange enchantment that allows it to shift its form to fit whatever animal is wearing it. Saddles can be found commonly in dungeon chests, or even occasionally when fishing, and can be applied to Horses, Donkeys, Mules, Skeleton Horses, and even Pigs by right-clicking it onto them. Saddled animals can be ridden by activating them, and can be dismounted by crouching - though the actual riding mechanics vary slightly from animal to animal. Saddles can be removed from most animals by opening your inventory while riding the Saddled animal and pulling it out of the Saddle slot. Saddles can only be retrieved from Pigs, however, by killing them, so don't get too careless with which animals you're Saddling. Despite their crafting recipe being unknown, Saddles can still be split back into their original crafting ingredients - provided you can find a means of doing so, that is.
guide.guidance.minecart.title=Minecart
guide.guidance.minecart.desc=A simple cart made of Iron. It can be placed on Rails, and will follow their path when pushed or moved by any means. Minecarts can be ridden by activating them, and can be accelerated to high velocities using Golden Rails, making them a useful method for traveling long distances quickly. Minecarts can also pick up mobs by running into them, as well as certain other entities such as Armor Stands, allowing you to move entities long distances without having to carefully Lead them all the way. Minecarts can be broken by either punching them multiple times, shooting them with Arrows, striking them with a Sword, or running them into obstacles such as Lava or Cacti, and drop as an item when broken so they can be re-used later. Minecarts can also be placed onto Rails by shooting them out of a Dispenser, and passing over a powered Activator Rail will cause them to eject any player or entity riding them, making auto-reloading and unloading Minecart stations relatively simple to set up.



## Weapons ##
guide.guidance.gold_sword.title=Golden Sword
guide.guidance.gold_sword.desc=A decorative but useless Sword made of Gold. It can be used to break various types of blocks very slightly faster, but its main purpose is for combat. Striking an unarmored mob or player with a Golden Sword will deal 2 hearts of damage - 4 times as much as striking with your fists. After attacking, a "recharge meter" will appear - attacking before this meter refills (which takes approximately 5/8ths of a second) will deal less damage than normal relative to how full the bar is. Additionally, striking while moving slower than normal walking speed and while the charge meter is full will deal a "sweep attack" - dealing half a heart of damage to all mobs or players surrounding the terget, and knocking them away from you as well. This feature makes Swords more optimal than Axes for dealing with large crowds of foes, as they can not only strike faster, but also help to prevent yourself from being surrounded and overwhelmed. Unlike Axes, however, Sword strikes can be blocked with a Shield, making Swords less optimal for one-on-one combat with another player. Striking a mob or player will also deal one point of durability damage to the Sword, giving it a maximum of 33 uses.
guide.guidance.wood_sword.title=Wooden Sword
guide.guidance.wood_sword.desc=A sloppily crafted Sword made of Wood. It can be used to break various types of blocks very slightly faster, but its main purpose is for combat. Striking an unarmored mob or player with a Wooden Sword will deal 2 hearts of damage - 4 times as much as striking with your fists. After attacking, a "recharge meter" will appear - attacking before this meter refills (which takes approximately 5/8ths of a second) will deal less damage than normal relative to how full the bar is. Additionally, striking while moving slower than normal walking speed and while the charge meter is full will deal a "sweep attack" - dealing half a heart of damage to all mobs or players surrounding the terget, and knocking them away from you as well. This feature makes Swords more optimal than Axes for dealing with large crowds of foes, as they can not only strike faster, but also help to prevent yourself from being surrounded and overwhelmed. Unlike Axes, however, Sword strikes can be blocked with a Shield, making Swords less optimal for one-on-one combat with another player. Striking a mob or player will also deal one point of durability damage to the Sword, giving it a maximum of 60 uses.
guide.guidance.stone_sword.title=Stone Sword
guide.guidance.stone_sword.desc=A roughly hewn Sword made of stone. It can be used to break various types of blocks very slightly faster, but its main purpose is for combat. Striking an unarmored mob or player with a Stone Sword will deal 2.5 hearts of damage - 5 times as much as striking with your fists. After attacking, a "recharge meter" will appear - attacking before this meter refills (which takes approximately 5/8ths of a second) will deal less damage than normal relative to how full the bar is. Additionally, striking while moving slower than normal walking speed and while the charge meter is full will deal a "sweep attack" - dealing half a heart of damage to all mobs or players surrounding the terget, and knocking them away from you as well. This feature makes Swords more optimal than Axes for dealing with large crowds of foes, as they can not only strike faster, but also help to prevent yourself from being surrounded and overwhelmed. Unlike Axes, however, Sword strikes can be blocked with a Shield, making Swords less optimal for one-on-one combat with another player. Striking a mob or player will also deal one point of durability damage to the Sword, giving it a maximum of 132 uses.
guide.guidance.iron_sword.title=Iron Sword
guide.guidance.iron_sword.desc=A fairly standard Sword made of Iron. It can be used to break various types of blocks very slightly faster, but its main purpose is for combat. Striking an unarmored mob or player with an Iron Sword will deal 3 hearts of damage - 6 times as much as striking with your fists. After attacking, a "recharge meter" will appear - attacking before this meter refills (which takes approximately 5/8ths of a second) will deal less damage than normal relative to how full the bar is. Additionally, striking while moving slower than normal walking speed and while the charge meter is full will deal a "sweep attack" - dealing half a heart of damage to all mobs or players surrounding the terget, and knocking them away from you as well. This feature makes Swords more optimal than Axes for dealing with large crowds of foes, as they can not only strike faster, but also help to prevent yourself from being surrounded and overwhelmed. Unlike Axes, however, Sword strikes can be blocked with a Shield, making Swords less optimal for one-on-one combat with another player. Striking a mob or player will also deal one point of durability damage to the Sword, giving it a maximum of 251 uses.
guide.guidance.diamond_sword.title=Diamond Sword
guide.guidance.diamond_sword.desc=A high quality Sword made of Diamond. It can be used to break various types of blocks very slightly faster, but its main purpose is for combat. Striking an unarmored mob or player with a Diamond Sword will deal 3.5 hearts of damage - 7 times as much as striking with your fists. After attacking, a "recharge meter" will appear - attacking before this meter refills (which takes approximately 5/8ths of a second) will deal less damage than normal relative to how full the bar is. Additionally, striking while moving slower than normal walking speed and while the charge meter is full will deal a "sweep attack" - dealing half a heart of damage to all mobs or players surrounding the terget, and knocking them away from you as well.

Striking a mob or player will also deal one point of durability damage to the Sword, giving it a maximum of 1562 uses.



## Specialty Weapons ##
guide.guidance.bow.title=Wooden Bow
guide.guidance.bow.desc=A Bow made of supple wood and Spider String. Holding a bow and holding right-click while you have Arrows in your inventory will draw the Bow back. Once the Bow is drawn, releasing right-click will fire an Arrow, sending it soaring in an arc in the direction you are facing. Drawing the bow back farther will increase the range of this arc, allowing you to hit mobs and players from farther away. Reaching the maximum draw level will also cause the Arrow to deal more damage to any entities it hits. Bows will normally consume one Arrow and one durability per use (out of a maximum of 385 uses), though enchanting it with Infinity will prevent it from consuming normal Arrows at all.
guide.guidance.arrow.title=Arrow
guide.guidance.arrow.desc=A sharp projectile intended to be fired from a Bow. They can be crafted with Flint, Sticks, and Feathers, but are often easier obtained by killing Skeletons. When a Bow is drawn and fired, it will shoot one Arrow from the your inventory in the direction you are currently facing. If the Arrow strikes a mob or another player, it will deal damage to them - otherwise it will usually just lodge itself into a block, where it can be picked up by walking near it. Unlike most weapons, Arrows do not have a fixed damage amount - rather, their damage is calculated by how fast they were traveling when they struck the entity. This means that the longer the Bow is charged before firing, the more damage the Arrow will deal. Like most entities, Arrows will be lit on fire when passing through Lava, and flaming Arrows will ignite any entities they hit. Additionally, wven if an Arrow gets stuck in a block, it will fall downwards if the block is broken, damaging any entity it stikes on the way down. Like most projectiles, Arrows can be fired from Dispensers, which send them about as far as they would fly from a fully charged Bow.
guide.guidance.spectral_arrow.title=Spectral Arrow
guide.guidance.spectral_arrow.desc=An Arrow imbued with Glowstone Dust. It behaves exactly like a normal Arrow, but imbues any mob or player it strikes with the Glowing effect for 10 seconds, making them useful for targeting mobs in the dark or trying to hit players who are hiding behind barracades.
guide.guidance.tipped_arrow.title=Tipped Arrow
guide.guidance.tipped_arrow.desc=An Arrow coated with the contents of a Lingering Potion. As one might expect, these Arrows behave exactly like normal Arrows, but also apply their specific Potion effect to any mob or player they hit. The effect duration of the Potion Arrow is much shorter than that of the Potion used to craft it, but they have the added benefits of being stackable, as well as being able to hit mobs from a much longer range than that of a Splash or Lingering Potion. If you are carrying multiple types of Tipped Arrows and want to shoot a specific type, holding a stack of Arrows in the off-hand will prioritize those Arrows over all others - otherwise, the Bow will simply shoot an Arrow from whichever stack is closest to the bottom left of your inventory.



## Armor ##
guide.guidance.leather_helmet.title=Leather Cap
guide.guidance.gold_helmet.desc=A roughly hewn Helmet made of Leather. When worn in the head slot, it will grant you 0.5 extra bars of armor protection, absorbing 4% of any non-armor-ignoring damage you may recieve. Absorbing damage deals one point of durability damage to the Helmet, however, giving it a maximum of 56 uses. Helmets can be enchanted with all the standard Armor enchantments - Protection, Blast Protection, Thorns, etc - but can also uniquely be enchanted with Aqua Affinity, which allows you to break blocks faster underwater, and Respiration, which causes your air supply to deplete more slowly while underwater. Unlike all other types of Armor, Leather Armor can also be dyed, making it useful as decorative clothing for those who don't often engage in combat.
guide.guidance.leather_chestplate.title=Leather Tunic
guide.guidance.leather_chestplate.desc=A roughly hewn Chestplate made of Leather. When worn in the body slot, it will grant you 1.5 extra bars of armor protection, absorbing 12% of any non-armor-ignoring damage you may recieve. Absorbing damage deals one point of surability damage to the Chestplate, however, giving it a maximum of 81 uses.

guide.guidance.leather_boots.title=Leather Boots
guide.guidance.leather_boots.desc=A decorative pair of Boots made of Leather. When worn in the feet slot, they will grant you 0.5 extra bars of armor protection, absorbing 4% of any non-armor-ignoring damage you may recieve. Absorbing damage deals one point of durability damage to the boots, however, giving them a maximum of 66 uses. Boots can be enchanted with all the standard Armor enchantments - Protection, Blast Protection, Thorns, etc - but can also uniquely be enchanted with Depth Strider, which allows you to move faster in Water, Feather Falling, which reduces the amount of fall damage you take, and Frost Walker, which freezes all the Water blocks below you in a small circle, allowing you to effectively walk on Water. Unlike all other types of Armor, Leather Armor can also be dyed, making it useful as decorative clothing for those who don't often engage in combat.
guide.guidance.gold_helmet.title=Golden Helmet
guide.guidance.gold_helmet.desc=A decorative Helmet made of Gold.

Helmets can be enchanted with all the standard Armor enchantments - Protection, Blast Protection, Thorns, etc - but can also uniquely be enchanted with Aqua Affinity, which allows you to break blocks faster underwater, and Respiration, which causes your air supply to deplete more slowly while underwater. Interestingly, unlike Golden Tools and Weapons, Golden Armor is actually not the worst of all the Armor sets, and actually gives more protection than that of Leather Armor.
guide.guidance.gold_chestplate.title=Golden Chestplate
guide.guidance.gold_chestplate.desc=A decorative Chestplate made of Gold. When worn in the body slot, it will grant you 2.5 extra bars of armor protection, absorbing 20% of any non-armor-ignoring damage you may recieve.

Interestingly, unlike Golden Tools and Weapons, Golden Armor is actually not the worst of all the Armor sets, and actually gives more protection than that of Leather Armor.
guide.guidance.chain_helmet.title=Chain Helmet
guide.guidance.chain_helmet.desc=A specially crafted Helmet made of Chainmaille. When worn in the head slot, it will grant you 1 extra bar of armor protection, absorbing 8% of any non-armor-ignoring damage you may recieve. Absorbing damage deals one point of durability damage to the Helmet, however, giving it a maximum of 166 uses. Helmets can be enchanted with all the standard Armor enchantments - Protection, Blast Protection, Thorns, etc - but can also uniquely be enchanted with Aqua Affinity, which allows you to break blocks faster underwater, and Respiration, which causes your air supply to deplete more slowly while underwater. Despite having almost identical protection and durability values to those of Iron Armor, Chain Armor is much more complicated to create, and can thus usually only be found being sold by Testifican merchants or abandoned within the ancient strongholds of the Humans.
guide.guidance.chain_chestplate.title=Chain Chestplate
guide.guidance.chain_chestplate.desc=A specially crafted Chestplate made of Chainmaille. When worn in the body slot, it will grant you 2.5 extra bars of armor protection, absorbing 20% of any non-armor-ignoring damage you may recieve.
